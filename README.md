## Motivation

If you've used `set exrc` before, you would be informed that using it might execute malicious code, see
[`:h 'exrc'`][vim-exrc]. Therefore, you would've been advised to also enable `set secure` to disable some vim config
options like `autocmds`, shell executions and write commands, see [`:h 'secure'`][vim-secure].

However, there might some options you may want to conditionally set in a project-level basis but the limitations of
`secure` restrict you those options.

__ProjectCMD__ tries to tackle this by not using `set secure` or `set exrc` but sourcing a .vim/.lua file in
your `$PROJECT_DIR/.vim/init.vim`/`$PROJECT_DIR/.vim/init.lua` - if allowed by the user - and execute the code once its
determined safe.

Essentially, the goal of this plugin is to help you safely source your project-specific options. Think of it like an
`.vscode/settings.json` file but for vim.

### Example

For example, let's say you're using [ALE][ale-plugin] on a JavaScript project and you only want to enable tsserver,
eslint and prettier for your code. Within your `$PROJECT_DIR/.vim/init.vim` you can add:

```vim
" $PROJECT_DIR/.vim/init.vim
autocmd! FileType javascript let b:ale_linters = ['tsserver', 'eslint'] | let b:ale_fixers = ['prettier']
```

This will introduce two different flows for loading the local config file - which is by default
`$PROJECT_DIR/.vim/init.lua`

#### First time flow

The __first time flow__, will be when you open nvim for the first time, after adding the local config file:

1. You will be prompted to add the local config file to the allowlist
2. By saying (pressing any other key will perform the last action on this list):
    1. `y`, it will add it to the allowlist and source the file
    2. `n`, it will then be ignored until you manually source it yourself (see: [Autoloading](#autoloading))
    3. `c`, it will then be ignored until you re-open nvim, to show the prompt

#### Change flow

The __change flow__, will be when you make changes to the local config file:

1. You will be prompted to update the allowlist with the new checksum
2. By saying (pressing any other key will perform the last action on this list):
    1. `y`, it will add the updated checksum to the allowlist and source the file
    2. `c`, it will then be ignored until you re-open nvim, to show the prompt

## Installation

IMPORTANT: [Neovim nightly][nightly] (v0.5 or build from `master` branch) is __required__.

Install via a plugin manager, any one will do, here are some examples using packer, minpac, vim-packager and vim-plug.

[packer.nvim][packer]

```lua
use 'creativenull/projectcmd.nvim'
```

[Minpac][minpac]

```vim
call minpac#add('creativenull/projectcmd.nvim')
```

[vim-packager][vim-packager]

```vim
call packager#add('creativenull/projectcmd.nvim')
```

[vim-plug][vim-plug]

```vim
Plug 'creativenull/projectcmd.nvim'
```

## Configuration

```vim
" init.vim
lua require 'projectcmd'.setup {}
```

```lua
-- init.lua
require 'projectcmd'.setup {}
```

### Commands

#### `:PCmdLoadConfig`

Opens the local config file in your project.

#### `:PCmdOpenAllowlist`

Opens the allowlist, displaying all your project directories that are to source the local config file.

#### `:PCmdOpenIgnorelist`

Opens the ignorelist, displaying all your project directories that are NOT allowed to be source, unless specified
manually, or explicitly deleted from the ignorelist.

#### `:PCmdEnable`

Manually source the local config file if not done on the first prompt.

### Autoloading

By default this is enabled, this means the plugin will source the local config file on load. If you want to manually source the
local config file, then set the `enable` key to `false`. To manually source use `:PCmdEnable`, this will add the project
to the allowlist but you will still need to `:PCmdEnable` every time you open vim in that project directory.

```lua
require 'projectcmd'.setup {
  enable = false
}
```

## Default Settings

Below are the default settings that are set, if not provided.

```lua
-- Default Settings
require 'projectcmd'.setup {
  enable = true,
  show_message = true,
  root_dir = '~/.cache/projectcmd',
  project_config_filepath = '/.vim/init.lua'
}
```

Key | Description
----|------------
`enable` | Let the plugin automatically source the project config file
`show_message` | Shows the message on command line bar, at the bottom of statusline
`root_dir` | Shows the message on command line bar, at the bottom of statusline
`project_config_filepath` | Location of the local config file in the project directory

## Troubleshooting

+ If you have `autochdir` enabled, make sure to disable it: `set noautochdir`. This messes with getting the current
working directory.
